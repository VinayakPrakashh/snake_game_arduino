# Snake Game with Hand Gesture Control
## Description:
This project is a Snake game implemented on an 8x8 LED matrix display controlled by hand gestures. It utilizes Arduino for the LED matrix and Python with OpenCV for hand gesture recognition.
## Components used:
1. Arduino UNO R3

5. Jumper Wires
6. Laptop
## Features:
1. Snake Game is implemented on 8*8 led matrix
2. Snake motion can be controlled using hand gestures
3. Snake grows when it eats the apple
4. If snake head hits body the game will reset itself
## Code:
1. The .ino file contains the code code for arduino and the code for snake is in this file().
2. .py file contains the code for gand gesture control
## How to control:
1. If the snake is moving horizontal direction rise the index finger to turn down and raise the pinky finger turn up
2. If the snake is moving in vertical direction rise the index finger to turn right and rise the pinky finger to turn left
